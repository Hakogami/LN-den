### Boogiepop volume 3 (LN) - 13/12/18

> Very likeable characters - Masaki Taniguchi was just so much more likeable as a protagonist than the protagonists of the first book. 
I love his little character arc of going around and beating people up as Boogiepop. It'll be great to see it animated. The philosophical parts confused me a bit. I'm not sure what *Imaginator* was at the end of the day. Well I know their motives, but I couldn't match it with the dialogue from volume 2. Feels inconsistent.
Such daring moves from this arc - a non-virgin (one who's been used for crossbreeding tests) main heroine - Orihata Aya and a casual gay dude. No wonder it took 20 years for it to get an adaptation. 
And that gang-rape scene the author used to troll me... It wasn't a gang-rape at all. I got tricked good. Which reminds me there has been almost no ecchi in the first 3 books, which is interesting considering there is a lot of sexual tension between the characters. 
Its representation of Japanese use feels a lot better than modern LNs and anime.

### Boogiepop volume 2 (LN) - 12/12/18

> Finished volume 2 of Boogiepop. One of the few cases the second volume is on par with the first one.

Structure-wise it still keeps the same structure of the story being told through different characters in an achronological order. Quite similar to Baccano. So similar I daresay Narita must have been influenced by Boogiepop. I think Boogiepop had strong influence on a lot of early 2000s LNs. Similar to how Index and SAO have influenced early 2010s LNs - as much as I don't like the two. Philosphical talk was hard to follow. I'm not sure what *Imaginator* is. I love how connected all the characters are. Some minor characters from the first book having a major roll in this volume was great.

### Boogiepop volume 1 (LN) - 09/12/18

> I just finished reading the first volume of Boogiepop. I quite liked it. It was somewhat hard to follow at times though, due its choice of narration style. The story is told through different characters until it all comes together. Quite similar to Baccano, but I had a harder time following this for some reason. It'll be interesting to see how they'll adapt it. Slightly philosophical which gives it a nice flavor.
