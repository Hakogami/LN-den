> Finished volume 4 of Boogiepop. That was a bittersweet ending. I didn't expect so many of the main characters to die... I can't really say I had a favorite character this volume - they were all interesting but none that really stuck out. I know these are short but they're really fast-paced too so I'm going through them really fast. This volume was narrated chronologically and was thus a lot easier to follow.  I highly doubt the anime will adapt this volume, but if they did it'd be interesting since it happens in parallel to volume 1. There are some shared characters - like Boogiepop obviously but it's mostly a story of its own. Nagi Kirima is quite integral to this story as well. Also, you really realize how old these are when the characters use fucking pagers lmao.

#### Boogiepop vs Imaginator 2 (LN)/ブギーポップ・リターンズ　VSイマジネーターPart2 - 13/12/18 - 267 pages

> Very likeable characters - Masaki Taniguchi was just so much more likeable as a protagonist than the protagonists of the first book. 
I love his little character arc of going around and beating people up as Boogiepop. It'll be great to see it animated. The philosophical parts confused me a bit. I'm not sure what *Imaginator* was at the end of the day. Well I know their motives, but I couldn't match it with the dialogue from volume 2. Feels inconsistent.
Such daring moves from this arc - a non-virgin (one who's been used for crossbreeding tests) main heroine - Orihata Aya and a casual gay dude. No wonder it took 20 years for it to get an adaptation. 
And that gang-rape scene... It wasn't a gang-rape at all. I got tricked good. Which reminds me there has been almost no ecchi in the first 3 books, which is interesting considering there is a lot of sexual tension between the characters. 
Its representation of Japanese use feels a lot better than modern LNs and anime. 
Suema Kazuko is an interesting character but feels a bit unrealistic for some reason. Aside from her all the other characters have been very easy to understand. They feel real. It's also interesting how in a series called Boogiepop, how rarely you can see Boogiepop make an apperance.

#### Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry volume 9 (LN)/ 落第騎士の英雄譚＜キャバルリィ＞９　- 12/12/18 - 307 pages

> It was an okay volume. Some nice fights I guess. The quite the explicit sex scene was unexpected. I'm starting to lose interest in the series as there's no damn proper drama. It's just the main characters getting stronger and people praising them. Not to mention the general writing quality. Not sure I'll read more than 1 more volume of this.

#### Boogiepop Vs Imaginator 1/ブギーポップ・リターンズ　VSイマジネーターPart1 (LN) - 12/12/18 - 244 pages 

> Finished volume 2 of Boogiepop. One of the few cases the second volume is on par with the first one.
Structure-wise it still keeps the same structure of the story being told through different characters in an achronological order. Quite similar to Baccano. So similar I daresay Narita must have been influenced by Boogiepop. I think Boogiepop had strong influence on a lot of early 2000s LNs. Similar to how Index and SAO have influenced early 2010s LNs - as much as I don't like the two. Philosphical talk was hard to follow. I'm not sure what *Imaginator* is. I love how connected all the characters are. Some minor characters from the first book having a major roll in this volume was great.

#### Boogiepop and Others/ブギーポップは笑わない (LN) - 09/12/18 - 270 pages

> I just finished reading the first volume of Boogiepop. I quite liked it. It was somewhat hard to follow at times though, due its choice of narration style. The story is told through different characters until it all comes together. Quite similar to Baccano, but I had a harder time following this for some reason. It'll be interesting to see how they'll adapt it. Slightly philosophical which gives it a nice flavor.
