This is Hako's den. Here I compile all sorts of LN-related and even non-LN related stuff. Everything from book impressions, reviews to character relationship diagrams. It's basically a blog of sorts you could say.

### Light novels

I'm not gonna explain here how light novels originated. If you're here, you probably already know. I can however tell you how to know if a book counts as a light novel or not. The main rule is that it has to be published in a light novel label, such as Dengeki Bunko or Kodansha Ranobe Bunko. They almost always have anime style illustrations, and feel very anime-like. The target audience is young adults. So LNs do fit into YA category. It isn't always that easy to tell if a book is a light novel or not. There are some labels that publish both LNs and general literature(regular books basically). Rather their books are neither LNs nor general literature. Kodansha Box is one of such. Since Monogatari series published by Kodansha Box is usually considered a light novel - despite the fact they are published in the (ugly) BOX format - the whole label is often considered a borderline LN label. 


### Light bungei

Lately, perhaps due to the LN publishers narrowing down the type of stories that get published as light novels more and more - to a point where it's almost exclusively LITRPG, fluff, romcom and alike, a cross of sorts between light novels and general literature has been born. They're often called "kyarakuta noberu"(character novels) or  "raito bungei"(light literature). It is a relatively new classification. And perhaps one that's somewhat unnecessary due to these types of books often being marketed as regular literature. I'll use the terms **"light bungei"** and **"light literature"** interchangeably. 

**One main differences from light novels is often the lack of cutesy "moe style art".** Light literature has an illustrated cover but rarely any other illustrations. Even if there are illustrations they are more like[ chapter titles such as this](https://imgur.com/uFZBkSe). So basically the number of illustrations if any are a lot fewer than light novels and have less cutesy style. Compare [Biblia covers](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/bbd360fde8823be792682fef9adb8d621486707411_full.jpg) to light novel covers [like these](https://worldwithouthorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/lanovel_1.jpg). Biblia is an interesting title since it's published by Media Works, which never actually called their books "light bungei", but most of those are still considered as such by the readers. 

**Another big difference is in the genres and lack of light novel tropes.** There is a lot more variety in light literature. These days light novels are mainly harem, LITRPG, romcom, while light bungei is often romance, sci-fi, horror and mystery. Light literature is also a lot less "tropey". No falling on girl's boobs and stuff. 

**Light literature often has older characters**. Not always but often characters in light literature are older than light novels. Not to mention light literature has a broader target audience. Light novels are usually for people in their 10s and early 20s while light literature extends to 30s and beyond. This isn't completely true however since LNs such as Death March is read by a lot of people in their 40s. It doesn't mean they're "mature" stories though unlike what light bungei tries to go for. 

An example of a light bungei label would be Shinchou Bunko Nex. 


### SF books

Although some books are widely considered as LNs in the community they're simply published as SF books. Ergo they count as general literature. Or perhaps light bungei if you want to call them that. Examples are books published by Hayakawa Shobo. Seikai series is generally considered a light novel despite the lack of illustrations and being considered general literature by the publisher. So Seikai series is something that falls inbetween LNs and general literature.
